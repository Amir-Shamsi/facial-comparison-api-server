  ![fscs-0](/public/assets/img/fscs-0.png)
  
- If you have image urls For body we need a `sourceFace` and `targetFace` so it must look like this:
  ```
  {
    "sourceFace": "https://amirshamsi.ir/u/59437623?v=4/amir-1.jpg",
    "targetFace": "https://amirshamsi.ir/u/59437623?v=4/amir-1.jpg"
  }
  ```
  
  ![fscs-4](/public/assets/img/fscs-4.png)
  
- If you don't have image urls and you want send images For body  `sourceFace` and `targetFace` with type *File* must be defined, like this:

  ![fscs-4](/public/assets/img/fscs-3.png)
  
- The respond an result will looks like this
  - Body:
  
    ![fscs-3](/public/assets/img/fscs-3.png)
    
  - Header:
  
    ![fscs-1](/public/assets/img/fscs-1.png)
